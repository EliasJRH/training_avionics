For the week of Oct 4th, 2021, please finish the following problem sets: 1-7 


You'll need to generate your own test cases to test your solutions. For example,
in question 1, you are asked to print out an array in reverse order. You'll need to
write your program like this: 

void print_rev_order(int* [], int len){
____ //<-4 spaces (don't use a tab!) //your solution
} 


int main (void){
	int ex[3] = {3,4,1}
	print_rev_order(example);
}


Note that 'ex' is a pointer to the first element in an continguous section of 
memory that contains your array. In memory, the array looks like this:

	address | value stored 
ex->	0x00001   3               
	0x00002   4
	0x00003   1

when you make an array, the name of that array is always a pointer to the first 
element in memory. If you're unfamiliar with pointers and how memory is stored on
your computer, don't fret! It's not complicated, and can you read up in the book:
