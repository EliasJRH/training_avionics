# training_avionics
This respository is built to train the next greatest generation of avionics experts!

To start your training, we will get you familiar with C coding and with using Github.
The goal is to build one project a day, and push it to Github. Along the way, you'll 
become more comfortable with using Github, and you'll feel like you can delve into the
more complex and nuanced features in Github and the C-programming language.
